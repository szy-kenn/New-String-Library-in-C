# New-String-Library-in-C

An attempt to make an improved string library in C.

## Improvements / Changes

This repository is created mainly with the reason of learning **string manipulation** and **pointers** in C, but
I will still try to offer more functionalities that can provide a much more beginner-friendly and an easier 
and broader way to manipulate strings in C.

### Preexisting Functions:

```
- strlib_copy
```
 (similar to string.h's _strcpy_)
